# Honeybot Configuration
# A Clawdbot skill for detecting malicious manipulation attempts

detection:
  # Sensitivity level: low, medium, high, paranoid
  # Higher sensitivity = lower thresholds = more aggressive detection
  sensitivity: medium

# Hybrid analyzer settings (regex + LLM)
analyzer:
  # When to use LLM analysis (in addition to regex)
  # Options: always, smart (default), never
  # - always: Run LLM on every message (thorough but costly)
  # - smart: Run LLM only when regex is uncertain or threat elevated
  # - never: Regex only (fast and free, but misses sophisticated attacks)
  llm_mode: smart

  # Message length threshold for LLM classification when regex finds nothing
  complexity_threshold: 100

  # Run conversation-level LLM analysis every N messages
  conversation_analysis_interval: 5

  # Use LLM to generate dynamic honeypot responses
  llm_responses: true

# Manual threshold overrides (optional - sensitivity presets work well for most cases)
# thresholds:
#   monitor: 30    # Start monitoring at this score
#   honeypot: 60   # Activate honeypot mode at this score
#   alert: 60      # Send alert at this score
#   block: 80      # Block user at this score

alerts:
  # Where to send alerts: log, telegram, email, webhook
  channels:
    - log
    # - telegram
    # - email

  # Include conversation history in alerts
  include_conversation: true

  # Webhook URL for custom integrations (optional)
  # webhook_url: https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/honeybot

blocklist:
  # Automatically block users who exceed the block threshold
  auto_block: true

  # How long to block: 'permanent' or number of hours (e.g., 24)
  block_duration: permanent

  # Share anonymous threat intel with Clawdbot community (opt-in)
  share_with_community: false
